/* Pipeline table translation to OpenFlow
 * ======================================
 *
 * The Pipeline table obtained from the OVN_Southbound database works in terms
 * of logical entities, that is, logical flows among logical datapaths and
 * logical ports.  This code translates these logical flows into OpenFlow flows
 * that, again, work in terms of logical entities implemented through OpenFlow
 * extensions (e.g. registers represent the logical input and output ports).
 *
 * Physical-to-logical and logical-to-physical translation are implemented in
 * physical.[ch] as separate OpenFlow tables that run before and after,
 * respectively, the logical pipeline OpenFlow tables.
